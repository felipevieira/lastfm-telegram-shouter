# lastfm-telegram-shouter
Posts scrobbles of users it's watching to a channel.

This uses [telepot](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot) as its telegram wrapper and [pylast](https://github.com/pylast/pylast) as its last.fm wrapper.

I made this as an exercise in threaded stuff, and because my friends and I thought it'd be cool to have a channel that shows what we're listening to.
